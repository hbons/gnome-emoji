# Priorities

Creating a full set of emoji is a major task, clocking at around 800 items. To keep us motivated and follow the release early mantra, we should first cover assets that are most needed. 

## Emotes

The first milestone incorporates essential emotes spanning the U+1F600 - U+1F64F range. We also aim to produce a functional font to be tested at this point.

## Everything else

Everything else beyond that point is pretty hard to evaluate. A good metric for usefulness is http://www.emojitracker.com/ which tracks emoji use on twitter in real time.
